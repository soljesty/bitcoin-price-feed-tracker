Bitcoin Pulse is a real-time cryptocurrency tracker that fetches live Bitcoin prices using the Coinbase Websocket Feed
and displays the data on an interactive graph. The application is built using a microservices architecture,
leveraging Spring Boot, Kafka, and React to provide a scalable and efficient solution for real-time tracking.
